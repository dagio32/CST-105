Milestone #7 for the project.  This folder includes updated versions of Main.java, PlayerManager.java, and NFLPlayer.java, as well as a new class, Celebrator.java.

Celebrate.java contains a void method called celebrate().  This is implemented in NFLPlayer.java in the base NFLPlayer class, as well as its subclasses OffensivePlayer, DefensivePlayer, and SpecialTeamsPlayer.

PlayerManager.java contains new sort methods to be used when displaying the grid of players.

Main.java creates a basic GUI displaying the names of the players in the draft, their position, and their college.  This will be fully featured in the final version, allowing players to be drafted, as well as viewing their player card with statistics and other information.
