Milestone #4 for the project.  This folder includes the PlayerManager.java class, the Main.java class, and an updated version of NFLPlayer.java.

The NFLPlayer.java class has been updated to include getter and setter methods for each field.  The fields have all been made private, so direct access to the class fields is no longer possible.  There is also a new getFullName method which concatenates the firstName and lastName fields and adds a space in between.  This will be used in the search feature, as well as to display a player's name on his player card.
