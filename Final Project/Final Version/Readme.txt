Final version of the project.  This folder includes all of the source code, including new classes DialogBox.java, PlayerCard.java, and TeamReview.java.  Main.java has been updated and contains the main GUI.

DialogBox.java is used to display warning messages to the user, such as when attempting to draft a player already drafted or removing a player who is not on the roster.

PlayerCard.java is used to display a pop-up window displaying the player's name, college, measurables, stats, and combine results.

TeamReview.java is used to display the final roster after drafting.  The user has the option of going back and making changes before exiting the application.

Pro Football Draft Simulator.jar has also been included as an executable version of the application.
