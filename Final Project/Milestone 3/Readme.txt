Milestone #3 for the project.  This folder includes the PlayerManager.java class and an updated version of NFLPlayer.java.

PlayerManager.java contains a method called CreatePlayers() which creates an array of NFLPlayer[] and stores 50 custom players in the array with each player's information and statistics.

The NFLPlayer.java class has been updated to account for NFL Scouting Combine statistics, a boolean isDrafted value, and new constructors for each class.  These constructors automatically calculate values such as yard averages or quarterback rating based on the input of the other values.

Main.java implements the PlayerManager.java class, prints the total number of players to the console, and tests a player's statistics by printing them to the console.
